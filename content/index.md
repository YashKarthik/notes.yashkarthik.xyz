**Hi, I'm Yash Karthik.**

Right now, I'm:
- Learning PCB design and trying to fabricate my own board.
- Writing code at [Helicone](https://helicone.ai/) and living in SF (say hi if you're around).
- Studying computer engineering at [Waterloo](https://ece.engineering/).

Before that, I have:
- Shipped semi-viral web apps built using ai apis.
- Written firmware for [drones](https://www.uwarg.com/).
- Run linux on lego ev3.

Some lore:

<div style="padding-left: 20px">

_Five years ago I awoke in a strange new world: I learned to code._

_My friend and I were tasked with cleaning-up the robotics lab after a late night session. Rather than spending hours sorting the parts manually, we built a robot to do it for us (finishing the task in a few days instead of hours xD). I knew how transformative technology is. It had been all around us. But actually leveraging it myself to automate a mundane task was when I truly **grokked** the power of technology. Since then, I've built fast and beautiful web apps; efficient and powerful robots; slow and clunky(?) VMs; and learned to embrace the lightness of being a **perpetual beginner**._

I put this site up initially for my linear algebra notes, but it's grown a bit since then. CMD-K is your friend here.
