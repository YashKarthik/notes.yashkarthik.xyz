- Conductivity arises due to the electrons being _delocalized_.
- To transport an electron the state must be partially filled / contain an electron only part of the time.

# Metals
- In metals, the valence and conduction bands overlap (in terms of energy).
- And, the Fermi level[^1] lies within the overlapped region.
- Hence, the electrons flow easily when a voltage is applied.

- Semiconductors have a slightly larger band gap, so we need to heat them up (or do some tricks) to reduce the band gap to allow conduction.
- The band gap for insulators is too high and nothing can reduce it enough for conduction.

[^1]: highest occupied energy level at absolute zero.
