- More partially filled states => better conduction as the electrons have more places to be.
- We can either add electrons (into more bands) or remove them (from existing, filled bands).
## Doping
- (Assuming that the main atom in our lattice is silicon).
- The idea is to replace some of the silicon atoms in our lattice with atoms with atoms with a different number of electrons in their valence shell.
- The dopants must be similar to silicon, since they must fit within the lattice structure.
### Adding Electrons into the Conduction Band (Donor Impurities)
- If we manage to add some electrons into the conduction band, then the band has way more free spaces than electrons,
- So the electrons can be transported easily between spaces => conduction.
- If the dopant has more valence electrons than silicon then the extra electrons will be left with no space.
- These electrons sit near the conduction band, ready to jump into the conduction band where they can move around freely.
- This "sitting below the conduction band" brings the Fermi Level upward.
- In this case, the primary _charge carriers_ will be electrons, since they can move freely in the conduction bands. Hence, silicon doped with donors are called n-type semiconductors.
- Eg: phosphorus (more electrons, weak enough to let go).
### Remove Electrons from the Valence Band (Acceptor Impurities)
- If we remove a few electrons from the valence band, then these are equivalent:
- A full valence band minus a few electrons.
- An empty valence band with a positive charge.
- If the dopant has fewer valence electrons than silicon, then an empty space is freed up in the impure lattice.
- This presence of empty spaces brings the Fermi Level lower.
- This vacant space (hole) move around (in the sense that electrons move into it), hence this is a p-type semiconductor since it's relatively positively charged (positive charge carrier).
- Eg: boron (less electrons, strong enough to bind another).
